                  The <A href="http://www.bugatti.com/en/super-sport/360.html">Veyron Super Sport</A> features an engine power increase from the standard 1,001 PS (736 kW; 987 bhp) to 1,200 PS (880 kW; 1,200 bhp) and torque of 1,500 N·m (1,100 lbf·ft) and a revised aerodynamic package. &nbsp;It has a 431.072 km/h (267.856 mph) top speed, making it the fastest road car in production although it is electronically limited to 415 km/h (258 mph) to protect the tyres from disintegrating. &nbsp;It was shown publicly for the first time at the <A href="http://www.pebblebeachconcours.net">Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance</A> in August 2010. &nbsp;The first five of an unannounced production run made its debut in a matte black and orange colour combination, all of which have been spoken for. &nbsp;It is valued at GB£1.7 million and Bugatti have stated that only 30 will be produced.

                  On 4 July 2010 <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_May">James May</A>, a television presenter on BBC 2's television show <A href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mj59">Top Gear</A>, drove the Veyron Super Sport at 417 km/h (259 mph). &nbsp;Later that day, Bugatti's official test driver <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Henri_Raphanel">Pierre Henri Raphanel</A> drove the Super Sport version of the Veyron on Volkswagen's Ehra-Lessien (near <A href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Wolfsburg,+Germany&hl=en&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=48.688845,93.076172&oq=wolfs&hnear=Wolfsburg,+Lower+Saxony,+Germany&t=m&z=11">Wolfsburg, Germany</A>) high-speed test track to establish the car's top speed. 
                  &nbsp;With representatives of the <A href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/">Guinness Book of Records</A> and <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technischer_%C3%9Cberwachungsverein">German Technical Inspection Agency (TÜV)</A> on hand, Raphanel made passes around the big oval in both directions achieving an average maximum speed of 431.072 km/h (267.856 mph), thus taking back the title from the <A href="http://www.sscnorthamerica.com/">SSC Ultimate Aero TT</A> as the fastest production vehicle of all time. &nbsp;The 431.072 km/h mark was reached by averaging the Super Sport's two test runs, the first reaching 427.93 km/h (265.90 mph) and the second 434.20 km/h (269.80 mph). &nbsp;Once produced for sale, the first five Super Sports will sport the same black and orange finish as the first production car which was used to set the speed record.

                  On 9 April 2013 the Title of "Fastest Production Car in the World" was revoked due to the deactivation of the electronic speed limiter which makes the car non stock, going against the rules of the title. &nbsp;Later, Bugatti´s speed record has been restored. &nbsp;"Following a thorough review conducted with a number of external experts, <A href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/">Guinness World Records</A> is pleased to announce the confirmation of Bugatti’s record of Fastest production car achieved by the Veyron 16.4 Super Sport. &nbsp;The focus of the review was with respect to what may constitute a modification to a car’s standard specification. Having evaluated all the necessary information, <A href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/">Guinness World Records</A> is now satisfied that a change to the speed limiter does not alter the fundamental design of the car or its engine."

Based on the Super Sport, the SuperVeyron is planned to be 250 kg (550 lb) lighter, mostly through utilizing more carbon fibre and further increasing aerodynamics. The Super Sport's 8.0 L W16 engine will be increased to 9.6 L to produce 1,200 kW (1,600 bhp), decreasing the 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) time to 1.8 seconds and increasing top speed to a planned 460 km/h (288 mph).</P>
